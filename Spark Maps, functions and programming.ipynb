If your songs list were split onto two machines, Machine A would first need to finish counting, and then return its own result to Machine B. And then Machine B could use the output from Machine A and add to the count.\n",

Machine B will simultaneously run a function to count how many times 'Despacito' appears on machine B. After they finish counting individually, they'll combine their results together.
